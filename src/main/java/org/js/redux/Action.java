/**
 * An *action* is a plain object that represents an intention to change the state. Actions are the
 * only way to getReducers data into the store. Any data, whether from UI events, network callbacks, or
 * other sources such as WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions.
 *
 * Actions must have a `type` field that indicates the type of action being performed. Types can be
 * defined as constants and imported from another module. It’s better to use strings for `type` than
 * Symbols because strings are serializable.
 *
 * Other than `type`, the structure of an action object is really up to you. If you’re interested,
 * check out Flux Standard Action for recommendations on how actions should be constructed.
