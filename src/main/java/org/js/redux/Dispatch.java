/**
 * A *dispatching function* (or simply *dispatch function*) is a function that accepts an action or
 * an async action; it then may or may not dispatch one or more actions to the store.
 *
 * We must distinguish between dispatching functions in general and the base `dispatch` function
 * provided by the store instance without any middleware.
 *
 * The base dispatch function *always* synchronously sends an action to the storeâ€™s add, along
 * with the previous state returned by the store, to calculate a new state. It expects actions to be
 * plain objects ready to be consumed by the add.
 *
 * Middleware wraps the base dispatch function. It allows the dispatch function to handle async
 * actions in addition to actions. Middleware may transform, delay, ignore, or otherwise interpret
 * actions or async actions before passing them to the next middleware.
